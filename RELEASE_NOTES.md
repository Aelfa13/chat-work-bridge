# Release notes

## v1.0.0

controlled APPLY now accepts valid Codex-generated patches with Markdown fence context, stale hunk counts, and zero-context hunks, while retaining existing workspace, target, and explicit APPLY safeguards.

## v1.0.0-rc.2

Failed Codex turns with `codexErrorInfo=serverOverloaded` are surfaced as a clear model-capacity failure instead of only the generic `CODEX_EXECUTION_FAILED` message. Raw upstream error details remain hidden.

## 1.0.0 stable

This stable V1 release exposes five STDIO MCP tools: `run_task`, `task_result`, `control_task`, `generate_controlled_patch`, and `apply_controlled_patch`. Ordinary `run_task` execution is always read-only. Successful interactive turns enter `waiting_for_supervisor_review`; `task_result` exposes state/readiness, bounded evidence, and `review_output` before acceptance, then final `output` or `error` after finalization. `control_task` is restricted to interactive `run_task` task IDs and state-checks `continue`, `steer`, `interrupt`, and `accept`. Continue preserves native Codex thread continuity; interrupt is available only while an interactive task is running and finalizes it as failed.

Controlled patch generation remains on the legacy proposal-task path. Poll its returned patch task ID through `task_result` until `state=completed`, when the unified diff is returned as `output`. Proposal tasks do not enter `waiting_for_supervisor_review`, do not expose `review_output`, and cannot be accepted through `control_task`. Human review occurs outside task state; an acceptable completed diff is passed directly to `apply_controlled_patch` with that `patch_task_id` and exact `APPLY`.

The Codex backend uses `codex app-server --stdio` without a shell, with approval `never` and network disabled. Ordinary/supervisor tasks and proposal generation stay read-only; exact reviewed `APPLY` is the filesystem write path. Bridge does not automatically test, stage, commit, or push. State is process-local with no restart recovery or automatic timeout; explicit interruption exists only for running interactive tasks. Alpha.4 project binding is not implemented, so `workspace_id` remains required.

This is the stable V1 / 1.0.0 release. It does not indicate npm publication.

## v0.2.0-alpha.3 release candidate

This release candidate reduces the public STDIO MCP interface to four tools: `run_task`, `task_result`, `generate_controlled_patch`, and `apply_controlled_patch`. `task_result` is now the single polling tool and reports active tasks with `ready: false`, completed output, or a fixed safe error. Serialized errors contain exactly `code` and `message` while preserving the existing error codes and non-leakage behavior.

Controlled patches may continue to modify existing tracked regular text files and may now add an ordinary text file when the diff uses exact `new file mode 100644` and matching `/dev/null` headers, contains a text hunk, and targets a safe path absent from base HEAD, the current index, and the worktree. Deletions and other unsafe patch forms remain rejected. Documentation has been reduced and aligned with this interface and behavior.

This is a release candidate description only. It does not assert that a v0.2.0-alpha.3 tag, GitHub Release, or npm publication exists.

## v0.2.0-alpha.2

Engineering Bridge v0.2.0-alpha.2 adds opt-in controlled writes while keeping every workspace read-only by default. A write-enabled clean Git workspace can generate a patch proposal without changing files; application requires human review and confirmation exactly equal to `APPLY`. Bridge rechecks repository state and patch targets before applying, and never automatically tests, stages, commits, or pushes.

This release also compares canonical real paths during controlled-write Git-root validation, so macOS aliases such as `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` no longer cause the same directory to be rejected. The English and Chinese READMEs explain client compatibility, component roles, a generic STDIO MCP configuration, a reproducible first read-only run, and the complete controlled-write flow. The architecture, security, threat-model, and tool-reference documents are aligned with the current implementation.

Current limits remain: no cancellation or timeout, no persistence across restart, no caller authentication or remote service, and no OS-level read containment for ordinary read-only tasks. Every proposal still requires human review.

This version has been published as a Git tag and GitHub Release.
