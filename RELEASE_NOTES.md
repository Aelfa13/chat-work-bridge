# Release notes

## v0.2.0-alpha.3 release candidate

This release candidate reduces the public STDIO MCP interface to four tools: `run_task`, `task_result`, `generate_controlled_patch`, and `apply_controlled_patch`. `task_result` is now the single polling tool and reports active tasks with `ready: false`, completed output, or a fixed safe error. Serialized errors contain exactly `code` and `message` while preserving the existing error codes and non-leakage behavior.

Controlled patches may continue to modify existing tracked regular text files and may now add an ordinary text file when the diff uses exact `new file mode 100644` and matching `/dev/null` headers, contains a text hunk, and targets a safe path absent from base HEAD, the current index, and the worktree. Deletions and other unsafe patch forms remain rejected. Documentation has been reduced and aligned with this interface and behavior.

This is a release candidate description only. It does not assert that a v0.2.0-alpha.3 tag, GitHub Release, or npm publication exists.

## v0.2.0-alpha.2

Engineering Bridge v0.2.0-alpha.2 adds opt-in controlled writes while keeping every workspace read-only by default. A write-enabled clean Git workspace can generate a patch proposal without changing files; application requires human review and confirmation exactly equal to `APPLY`. Bridge rechecks repository state and patch targets before applying, and never automatically tests, stages, commits, or pushes.

This release also compares canonical real paths during controlled-write Git-root validation, so macOS aliases such as `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` no longer cause the same directory to be rejected. The English and Chinese READMEs explain client compatibility, component roles, a generic STDIO MCP configuration, a reproducible first read-only run, and the complete controlled-write flow. The architecture, security, threat-model, and tool-reference documents are aligned with the current implementation.

Current limits remain: no cancellation or timeout, no persistence across restart, no caller authentication or remote service, and no OS-level read containment for ordinary read-only tasks. Every proposal still requires human review.

This version has been published as a Git tag and GitHub Release.
